	31/5/2020 - Boiler plate set up
	---
	This is something that I've wanted to do for a while. To set up a minimal react and webpack boilerplate.
	The goal was to learn a bit more about webpack rather than relying on create-react-app. And to know what each
	package I'm installing is actually used for.
	While I'm still far from an expert, it was pretty interesting getting everything to work.
	There was quite a bit of trial and error trying to convert my old set up over from create-react-app so ultimately I just started from scratch
	and followed along with a few tutorials.
